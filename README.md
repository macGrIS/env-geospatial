# York, Environment Geospatial User Group

:zap: **Welcome to the University of York, Geospatial User Group!** :zap:

We meet every other week in the Environment and Geography Department to offer an opportunity to share: short, introductory tutorials to the use of programming languages (e.g. Python, R, etc.) and software (e.g. QGIS) within geospatial research; the knowledge of the specific packages we use day-to-day; the approaches we may take to solve programmatic problems, as well as acting as a platform for people to ask questions about existing code and ideas to troubleshoot, improve, and advance our individual applications of GIS software (e.g. QGIS, ArcGIS) alongside Python/ R programming languages. 

The group, however, is not just limited to Python/ R users, with plenty of cross over extending to other scripting languages including, Matlab, (and if you're so inclined) IDL, etc.

**Please free to come along and listen to or join in the discussions.** For details on scheduling, please see below, and to keep up to date, join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/york.ac.uk/d/forum/env-geospatial-group).
